# 🧪 REST API Practice – Node.js & Express



This repository contains basic practice code for building RESTful APIs using **Node.js** and **Express.js**. It's part of my backend learning journey — experimenting with routing, JSON data, and HTTP methods.

## 📦 What's Inside

- Basic Express server setup
- Simple routing
- CRUD operations using in-memory JSON data

## 🚀 Run It Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akshaydarekar5252/REST-APIs.git
cd REST-APIs
npm install
node index.js
```

Then open your browser or Postman and test:  
📍 `http://localhost:3000`

## 📚 Purpose

This is **not a production-ready project** – just hands-on practice to understand how REST APIs work in Node.js.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
